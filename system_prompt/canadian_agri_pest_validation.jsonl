Pre-existing damage:\n- Was yield already compromised?\n- Pest damage vs hail damage\n- Affects payout calculation\n- Must separate causes\n\n2. Due diligence:\n- Did you manage crop properly?\n- Negligence can reduce claim\n- Industry standard practices expected\n- Records prove you tried\n\n3. Yield potential:\n- Your claim based on expected yield\n- Pest-reduced yield = lower baseline\n- Documentation supports your number\n\nWhat records help your claim:\n- Scouting reports (pest levels)\n- Spray records (you managed)\n- Crop staging notes\n- Pre-hail photos\n- Agronomist visits\n\nRed flags for adjusters:\n- No management records\n- Obvious untreated pest damage\n- Inflated yield expectations\n- Inconsistent story\n\nHow to handle:\n- Be honest about pest pressure\n- Show you managed appropriately\n- Separate hail damage clearly\n- Have agronomist support if possible\n\nProtect your claim:\n- Take hail damage photos immediately\n- Note date/time of event\n- Document areas affected\n- Compare to unaffected areas\n\nGood records = faster, fairer settlement. This is why record-keeping matters beyond pest management."}]}

Problem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Risk Score: 0.55 (MODERATE)\n\n14% moisture + moths = early warning sign.\n\nMoth identification matters:\n- Indian meal moth: Most common, surface feeder\n- Grain moths: Deeper penetration\n- Need ID for management\n\nWhy 14% is borderline:\n- Safe storage: <13% ideal\n- 14%: Marginal for long-term\n- Warm spots can exceed 14.5%\n- Moths indicate moisture pockets\n\nImmediate actions:\n\n1. Temperature check:\n- Core temperature probe\n- Look for hot spots\n- Should be <15°C for storage\n\n2. Aeration:\n- Run fans to equalize\n- Cool grain if possible\n- Target 5-10°C for winter\n\n3. Surface treatment:\n- Diatomaceous earth on surface\n- Disrupts moth breeding\n- Safe for feed/food\n\n4. Monitoring:\n- Pheromone traps in headspace\n- Check weekly\n- Track numbers\n\nMarketing consideration:\n- If counts increase: Sell sooner\n- Premium markets reject moths\n- Feed market more tolerant\n\nFumigation (if escalates):\n- Phosphine effective\n- Requires professional\n- $500-1500 depending on size\n- Last resort\n\nPrevention: Dry to 12-13% before binning. Current situation is management issue, not disaster yet."}]}
